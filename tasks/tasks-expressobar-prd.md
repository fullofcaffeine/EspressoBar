### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration
- The project uses Electron Vite template as the foundation
- IPC communication must be secure using preload.ts and contextBridge
- Integration test script available at `tests/test-emacs-integration.js` for emacsclient setup validation

## Recent Changes (Version 1.0 - Org-Only Focus)

### User Experience Changes ✅ COMPLETED
- **Removed Quick Note Functionality**: Removed + Quick note button and capture modal - focusing purely on org file-based pins
- **Updated Click Behavior**: 
  - Single click on pin → Opens in Emacs (if filePath available)
  - Command/Ctrl+click on pin → Opens detail view modal
- **Added ESC Key Support**: ESC key now closes the window regardless of how it was opened (tray or keyboard shortcut)
- **Updated Empty State**: Now directs users to "Setup Org Directories" instead of adding quick notes

### Technical Implementation ✅ COMPLETED
- Updated `TrayPopup.tsx` to remove quick note button and implement new click behavior
- Updated `EmptyPopup.tsx` to focus on org directory setup instead of quick capture
- Updated `App.tsx` to remove capture modal functionality and add ESC key handling
- Added IPC handlers for window operations (hide/show/toggle)
- Updated shared types to remove `onAddPin` properties
- Updated all E2E tests to work with new behavior and org-file-only approach

### Test Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- Modified CRUD operations tests to work with org-file-only approach
- Updated pin detail view tests to use command-click for detail view
- Added test for single-click behavior (should not open detail view)
- Added test for ESC key functionality
- Updated empty state tests to check for "Setup Org Directories" button

## Current Development Phase: 10. Org File Pinning via #+filetags ✅ CORE FEATURE COMPLETED, ⏳ Pin Removal In Progress

### Implementation Strategy
**Requirement**: Support pinning entire org files via `#+filetags:` header with `:pinned:` tag, following org-roam conventions.

**Key Behaviors**:
1. **File-level Pins**: Files with `#+filetags: :pinned:` appear as pins
2. **Mixed Support**: Files can have both file-level pin and headline pins
3. **Visual Distinction**: File pins show with file icon/badge
4. **Click Behavior**: File pins open at line 1 in Emacs
5. **Content Display**: Show filename or #+title: as pin content
6. **Persistence**: File pins persist across scans like headline pins

**TDD Approach**:
- Write E2E tests first to define expected behavior
- Implement parser changes to detect filetags
- Update UI to distinguish file pins visually
- Ensure all existing functionality remains intact

### 10.1 Data Model & Type System Updates ✅ COMPLETED

  - Parse existing filetags line (e.g., `#+filetags: :tag1:pinned:tag2:`)
  - Remove only :pinned: tag while preserving other tags
  - Handle edge cases: only :pinned: tag, multiple spaces, case variations

### 🎯 Backend Implementation Summary ✅ COMPLETED:

- **Mixed Support**: Files with both file-level and headline pins work correctly (e.g., mixed-pins.org creates 3 total pins)
- **Content Display**: File pins show #+title or filename as content
- **Emacs Integration**: File pins open at line 1 when clicked
- **Persistence**: File pins survive app restarts and work with ordering system
- **Testing**: All 8 E2E tests passing with dedicated test-org-files-file-pins/ directory
- **Compatibility**: All existing tests (20/20) still pass, no regression introduced

### 🎨 UI Implementation Summary ✅ COMPLETED:
- **Visual Distinction**: File pins display blue File icons in TrayPopup to distinguish from headline pins
- **Detail Modal**: PinDetailModal shows "File Pin Details" vs "Headline Pin Details" with appropriate icons
- **Content Display**: File pins cleanly display #+title or filename with proper truncation
- **Responsive Design**: File icons and content layout work across different screen sizes
- **Testing**: All visual distinction tests passing, UI updates verified in E2E tests

### 🔧 Next Development Priority: Pin Removal & Tag Management
File pins are now fully implemented with visual distinction. The next major task is implementing pin removal functionality (task 10.9) to allow users to remove file pins by removing the :pinned: tag from #+filetags headers while preserving other tags.

**Implementation Notes**:

- File pins always open at line 1 when clicked or opened in Emacs ✅
- Both file pins and headline pins can coexist in the same file ✅
- TDD approach successfully implemented: E2E tests written first, features implemented to pass ✅

- Both file pins and headline pins can coexist in the same file ✅
- TDD approach successfully implemented: E2E tests written first, features implemented to pass ✅
- Created separate test-org-files-file-pins/ directory to avoid breaking existing tests ✅
- File pin detection handles complex scenarios like `#+FILETAGS: :research:pinned:urgent:deadline:` ✅
