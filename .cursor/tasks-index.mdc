You MUST always check if for the request at hand there are tasks in tasks/tasks-expressobar-prd.md. If not, use [generate-tasks.mdc](mdc:.cursor/generate-tasks.mdc) to generate tasks for the request at hand, but first, verify if there are no ambiguous or duplicaate tasks that could conflict in the PRD.

Then, use [process-task-list.mdc](mdc:.cursor/process-task-list.mdc) to tackle the tasks.

Again, you SHOULD NOT start working on anything if it's not related to a task in the PRD.

After each task is completed, you should commit the work with a concise and meaningful commit message.
